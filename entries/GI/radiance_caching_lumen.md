Presents the Final Gather system used for the real-time GI system (Lumen) built into Unreal Engine 5

* A screen-space radiance cache is built at a low resolution (1/16), which is generated by tracing rays with importance sampling at 0.5 rays per pixel
* Radiance is stored in an 8x8 octahedral atlas with a border, and probes use adaptive placement with Hierarchal Refinement
* Structured importance sampling is used within the octahedral quadtree structure to improve quality
* Probes are filtered in cache space, not in screen space, using depth and angle weighting to reduce leaking
* The screen-space cache is augmented with a world space cache that represents stable distant lighting
* The final integration is performed at full resolution using a temporal filter and a full-resolution bent normal
