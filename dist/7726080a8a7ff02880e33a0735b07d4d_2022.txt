<p>This presentation describes a number of improvements over FSR 2.0's predecessor. It contains a useful overview of heuristics needed to achieve a high quality TAA image, and describes solutions for a number of problems typical in this space:</p>
<ul class="list-disc">
<li>Preserving thin features</li>
<li>Estimating the contribution of a sample in a frame</li>
<li>Blending the contributions of multiple samples</li>
<li>Resampling contributions during upscale</li>
<li>Motion vector dilation based on MV with nearest depth to the current sample</li>
<li>Avoiding ghosting (best effort) due to disocclusion or shading changes</li>
</ul>
