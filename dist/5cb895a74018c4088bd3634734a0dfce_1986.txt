<p>$$L_o(\mathbf{x}, \omega_o, \lambda, t) = L_e(\mathbf{x}, \omega_o, \lambda, t) + \int_\Omega f_r(\mathbf{x}, \omega_i, \omega_o, \lambda, t)L_i(\mathbf{x}, \omega_i, \lambda, t)(\omega_i \cdot \mathbf{n})d\omega_i$$</p>
<p>The integral above (with notation from wikipedia instead of as presented in the original paper) encapsulates effectively all of rendering as the transport of light scattered from a surface as seen in the image below.</p>
