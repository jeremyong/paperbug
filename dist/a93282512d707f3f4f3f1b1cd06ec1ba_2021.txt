<p>This talk presents work to implement precomputed GI large-scale maps used for Call of Duty: Warzone</p>
<ul class="list-disc">
<li>Discusses the probe-based approach used for storing GI data throughout the map, including an warped distribution for adaptive placement of probes along the terrain</li>
<li>Presents a novel compression scheme called &quot;Moving Basis Decomposition&quot; for reducing the storage space for GI by a ratio of 44:1</li>
<li>Uses a simple technique to prevent leaking between probes in the exterior and interior of buildings</li>
<li>Discusses approaches to contraining spherical harmonics light probe data to avoid ringing artifacts</li>
</ul>
