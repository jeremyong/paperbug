<p>Presents a selection of graphics techniques from the PlayStation 4 exclusive &quot;Ghost of Tsushima&quot;, focusing on indirect lighting, atmospheric effects, and tone mapping.</p>
<ul class="list-disc">
<li>Discusses how the game used a mixture of low-density regular grids of spherical harmonics probes combined with dense tetrahedral meshes for areas with more complex geometry (such as villages and castles)</li>
<li>Used a combination of precomputed and runtime probe information combined with runtime updates to handle dynamic time-of-day</li>
<li>Applied an interior/exterior mask as an additional probe interpolation weight to reduce leaking between probes</li>
<li>Computed indirect specular by dynamically re-lighting sparse cubemap probes containing G-Buffer informations, combined with shadow trace through captured cube map depth</li>
<li>Used precomputed LUT textures to apply atmospheric lighting and scattering, with calculations performed in a custom Rayleigh color space</li>
<li>Described how the Bilateral Grid algorithm was used to apply localized tone mapping, along with a custom color space for achieving desired roll-off behavior.</li>
</ul>
