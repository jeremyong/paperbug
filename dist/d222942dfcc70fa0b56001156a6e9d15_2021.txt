<p>Presents the Final Gather system used for the real-time GI system (Lumen) built into Unreal Engine 5</p>
<ul class="list-disc">
<li>A screen-space radiance cache is built at a low resolution (1/16), which is generated by tracing rays with importance sampling at 0.5 rays per pixel</li>
<li>Radiance is stored in an 8x8 octahedral atlas with a border, and probes use adaptive placement with Hierarchal Refinement</li>
<li>Structured importance sampling is used within the octahedral quadtree structure to improve quality</li>
<li>Probes are filtered in cache space, not in screen space, using depth and angle weighting to reduce leaking</li>
<li>The screen-space cache is augmented with a world space cache that represents stable distant lighting</li>
<li>The final integration is performed at full resolution using a temporal filter and a full-resolution bent normal</li>
</ul>
