<p>Presents the software implementation of variable rate shading (VRS) used by Activision in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, which does not leverage or require the hardware functionality for VRS that's available through D3D12 and Vulkan.</p>
<ul class="list-disc">
<li>Provides an overview of hardware VRS available in recent GPUs, which can set pixel shading rate for 8x8 tiles in screen space as well as per-primitive or per-draw</li>
<li>Describes how hardware VRS can suffer from quad overshading (poor quad occupancy) due to effectively decreasing triangle size in screen space</li>
<li>Presents an alternative approach that stores swizzled/intereaved samples in MSAA buffers, where shading rate can be varied at a fine granularity by using the stencil buffer to cull MSAA subsamples. This approach also does not suffer from the same issues with quad occupancy.</li>
<li>Describes a full implementation of the alternative software approach, including a screen-space analysis pass that dynamically determines the appropriate shading rate based a reprojection of the previous frame</li>
</ul>
